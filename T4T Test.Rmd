We're learning how to do R-stuff today
```{r}

library(curl)

rawdata <- curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhw629/tit_4_tat/master/t4t_quick-look_SUTS.csv")


rawdata <- read.csv(rawdata, header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)


head(rawdata)
#there were unnecessary columns 
rawdata <- rawdata[-c(15:26)]

head(rawdata)
 #going to separate into species now
wonder_woman <- rawdata[rawdata$SPP == "form",]
head(wonder_woman)

tippie <- rawdata[rawdata$SPP == "lat",]
head(tippie)

#there were unnecesary rows
rawdata <- rawdata[-c(11:987),]

cleandata <-rawdata[rawdata$SPP == "lat", "form"]

cleandata <- rawdata[rawdata$SPP == "form" "lat"]
```


### let's start analysis on **fish** *data* ***yo***

```{r}

"total sections" <- rowSums(rawdata[5:14])

cbind(rawdata)

head(rawdata)

rawdata2 <- "rawdata"(-c[11:987])

#going to sum up total counts for each fish

rowSums(rawdata[5:14])
total_count <- rowSums(rawdata[5:14])

rowSums(rawdata[5:14])

tippie <- cbind(tippie, rowSums(tippie[5:14]))
wonder_woman <- cbind(wonder_woman, rowSums(wonder_woman[5:14]))

newdata1 <- cbind(rawdata, rowSums(rawdata[5:14]))

#now to find the average count of each fish

section_average_fish <- function(section_avg) {section_avg/10}

lat_fish_average <- section_average_fish(tippie$`rowSums(tippie[5:14])`)

tippie2 <- cbind(tippie, lat_fish_average)
#ignore tippie2, test to see if function would work
tippie <- cbind(tippie, lat_fish_average)

form_fish_average <- section_average_fish(wonder_woman$`rowSums(wonder_woman[5:14])`)

wonder_woman <- cbind(wonder_woman, form_fish_average)

#now to calculate average time spent in each section across the whole species

mean(tippie$SEC1)

tippie2 <- rbind(tippie2, lapply(tippie2[5:14], mean(x)))
