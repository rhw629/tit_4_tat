We're learning how to do R-stuff today
```{r}

library(curl)

rawdata <- curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhw629/tit_4_tat/master/t4t_quick-look_SUTS.csv")


rawdata <- read.csv(rawdata, header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)


head(rawdata)
#there were unnecessary columns 
rawdata <- rawdata[-c(15:26)]

head(rawdata)
 #going to separate into species now
wonder_woman <- rawdata[rawdata$SPP == "form",]
head(wonder_woman)

tippie <- rawdata[rawdata$SPP == "lat",]
head(tippie)


```
